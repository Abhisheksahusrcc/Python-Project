In this project, I utilized the power of Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales data. ðŸ’¼ðŸ’»

Here are the key steps I followed in the analysis:

1.Loaded the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to leverage their powerful functionalities for data analysis.
2.Imported and loaded the data from CSV format into Python using the Pandas library, allowing for seamless data manipulation and analysis.
3.Performed data checks to understand the data, including examining the shape of the dataset, identifying any null values, and analyzing data types.
4.Removed unnecessary columns that were not relevant to the analysis, streamlining the dataset for focused insights.
5.Conducted data cleaning by checking and removing null values, considering their contribution to the overall dataset. Null values were dropped if their impact was minimal.
6.Converted data types of columns as required, ensuring consistency and compatibility for subsequent analysis.
7.Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to delve into the data, uncover patterns, correlations, and generate valuable insights. This involved visualizing the data using various techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
8.Made final predictions and drew conclusions based on the analysis, providing actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance during Diwali.
